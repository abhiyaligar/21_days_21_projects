# Customer Segmentation with K-Means

Customer segmentation is one of the most powerful applications of unsupervised machine learning in marketing and business analytics. This project uses K-Means clustering to segment customers based on their purchasing behavior, helping businesses design better strategies for targeted marketing.

## Project Overview
- Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on customer dataset.  
- Apply K-Means clustering algorithm to group customers.  
- Visualize the clusters for better insights.  
- Help businesses identify high-value and distinct customer segments.  

## Tech Stack
- Python 3  
- Jupyter Notebook  
- Libraries:  
  - pandas  
  - numpy  
  - matplotlib  
  - seaborn  
  - scikit-learn  


## How to Run
Clone this repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/21_days_21_projects/tree/main/3_customer_segmentation_with_k-means
cd 3_customer_segmentation_with_k-means
```

Launch Jupyter Notebook:

Open `Customer_segmentation_with_K_means.ipynb` and run all cells.

## Results
- Customers are segmented into k groups (chosen using Elbow Method & Silhouette Score).  
- Each segment shows distinct purchasing behavior.  
- Visualizations highlight customer distribution across clusters.  

## Use Cases
- Marketing: Personalized campaigns  
- Sales: Customer lifetime value prediction  
- Business Strategy: Identifying high-value customers
